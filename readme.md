## Covid-19 Dashboard Microsoft SQL Server Querying Project

The world has been hit by a devastating pandemic and it would be convenient to see all results of the pandemic so far in one place. This was the purpose of this project. 

My task was to collect, clean and present this data in a single dashboard so that users can easily browse the data and get a picture of the pandemic quickly at a single glance. 

For this analysis I'll be using a data set from ourworldindata.org. This is the most up to date information on the effects on the Covid-19 global pandemic.
